# Flappy Bird AI

### Responsibilities
 - Nima - Did everything


### Added functionalities 
- Saving your own best bird. if you want to load that, you can change the file path used in the GodBirdState class

### Missing functionalities 
- Playing against your best bird
- I ran my computer overnight in order to train a god bird, but I was saving the worst bird.... I will send a god_bird.ser to you by the end of the day

### Known bugs & errors
- Sometimes the training gets caught in a loop where the birds are only jumping up or down thinking its their best move, if so, reset the training so that the randomization can generate some better birds
- hitbox bugs (they arent very accurate)
- frame rate sometimes slows down when training

### Important information for marking my game
- run Game.java
- Getting good bird takes around 8000 generations (approx 3 hours) At 3000 generations you can see some good results though (approx 20 mintues)
